# Day-1 Networking Basics for Cybersecurity

## 🔢 IPv4 (Internet Protocol Version 4)
- Uses 32-bit addressing
- Example:
  192.168.1.1
- Limited address space (~4.3 billion)
- Commonly used in most networks

### Security Concerns
- IP spoofing
- Requires NAT
- Limited scalability

---

## 🔢 IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)
- Uses 128-bit addressing
- Example:
  2001:db8::1
- Provides a very large address space
- Better routing efficiency
- Supports IPSec

### Security Advantages
- No NAT
- Improved encryption support
- Better network segmentation

---

## 🌍 DNS (Domain Name System)
DNS translates domain names into IP addresses.

Example:
google.com → 142.250.195.78

### Common DNS Attacks
- DNS Spoofing
- DNS Hijacking
- Cache Poisoning

---

## 📡 DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
DHCP automatically assigns:
- IP address
- Subnet mask
- Default gateway
- DNS server

### DHCP Process (DORA)
1. Discover  
2. Offer  
3. Request  
4. Acknowledge  

### Security Risk
- Rogue DHCP servers
- Man-in-the-Middle attacks

---

## 🔐 VPN (Virtual Private Network)
A VPN creates a secure and encrypted tunnel over the internet.

### Uses
- Secure remote access
- Protect data on public Wi-Fi
- Hide IP address

### Types of VPN
- Remote Access VPN
- Site-to-Site VPN

### Risks
- Weak encryption
- Misconfiguration
- Logging by providers
